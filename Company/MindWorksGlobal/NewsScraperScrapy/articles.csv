2021-05-04,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —  Yesterday, at a roundtable with innovation leaders at Howard University, Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm highlighted the American Jobs Plan’s investments to bolster science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other minority serving institutions (MSIs). Watch a recording of the event  HERE . If we don’t invest in STEM students and faculty from diverse backgrounds,  “We are missing out on untapped talent … leav[ing] us with narrower innovation, and insufficient solutions to the problems we face,” Secretary Granholm said. “We simply can’t abide blind spots like this—particularly as we work towards our transition to clean energy...an inclusive transition, offering benefits to every community.” Increasing diversity in STEM fields is a key priority for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Biden-Harris Administration. As Secretary Granholm noted,  “We know that who’s at the table matters.” President Biden’s American Jobs Plan calls for a dedicated reserve of $20 billion in upgrading research infrastructure in laboratories at HBCUs and other MSIs, including the creation of a new HBCU-affiliated National Lab focused on climate. The plan also invests $10 billion in research and development at HBCUs and other MSIs and $15 billion to create up to 200 centers of excellence that serve as research incubators at HBCUs. Granholm also  announced $17.3 million  in DOE funding to support college internships, research projects and opportunities, and to bolster investment in underrepresented HBCUs and MSIs.   In The News Washington Post  |  Energy Department awards $17.3 million in research funding, targets students of color Biden’s proposal earmarks $40 billion to modernize laboratories throughout the country, a measure designed to increase research and development. Half of those dollars would be directed to historically Black schools and minority-serving institutions and help create a new national lab focused on climate change and affiliated with an HBCU, according to the White House. For universities such as Howard, the proposal would provide the resources students need, professors said. “Students need to have access to the latest and greatest of technologies so they can have hands-on training so that when they go into these corporations they are ready to go from day one,” said Quinton Williams, chair of Howard’s physics and astronomy department. E&E News  |  Granholm's first visit outside the office? Howard University Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm made her first outside-the-agency stop yesterday, pitching President Biden's $2.2 trillion infrastructure plan at Howard University — one of the historically Black colleges and universities that could benefit from its passage. Granholm told a roundtable that Biden's plan calls for $40 billion to upgrade research infrastructure in laboratories across the country, with half of the money reserved for historically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions. Biden's proposal also calls for a new Department of Energy national lab focused on the climate that would be affiliated with a historically Black school. ""This administration is committed to making the transition to clean energy an inclusive transition, offering benefits to every community because not every community has benefited,"" said Secretary Granholm, noting that many communities of color have been disproportionately harmed by pollution. ""We want to make sure that voices are at the table that are representative of the communities who can benefit from this transition.""

2021-04-30,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced up to $12 million for technologies that can make geothermal systems more efficient for clean, renewable energy production. This funding will help scientists and engineers unlock the full potential of geothermal power to help tackle the climate crisis, and achieve the Biden Administration’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  “Enhanced geothermal systems harness the clean, renewable energy that lives right beneath our feet—available at any time, in any weather, in any part of the country,” said  Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm . “This new funding will help us tap into its enormous potential to power millions of homes and businesses, reduce carbon emissions, and put thousands to work in greener, good-paying jobs.” Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) are man-made reservoirs created by injecting fluid into “hot rock,” which is heated by the natural warmth of the Earth’s core. The fluid re-opens pre-existing fractures, allowing it to circulate through the hot rock, and bring the heated water to the surface. That hot water becomes steam that spins a turbine, creating clean, renewable energy. The “Innovative Methods to Control Hydraulic Properties of Enhanced Geothermal Systems” funding opportunity will support the research, development, demonstration, and deployment of technologies and techniques to control the fluid flow in EGS reservoirs, enhancing the connectivity of pre-existing fracture networks and optimizing them for heat mining. This ability to customize reservoirs will increase their efficiency and longevity—driving down EGS costs, reducing the risk of development, and accelerating the path towards widespread commercialization. The 2019  GeoVision  study by DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) concluded that with technology improvements like those funded by today’s announcement, geothermal power generation could increase 26-fold, deploying 60 gigawatts-electric (GWe) of clean energy by 2050. Despite that vast potential, there are only 3.7 GWe of geothermal energy currently installed in the United States. GTO is using its research and development portfolio to advance technologies and projects that can rapidly increase that number, while supporting thousands of good-paying jobs for American workers—including those in the oil and gas industries that  already have matching skills and expertise . GTO is looking for applications that address the funding opportunity review criteria in full. Applications are due by 5:00 p.m. ET on June 15, 2021.

2021-04-23,"There is no greater challenge facing our nation and our planet than the climate crisis. That’s why President Biden has laid out the boldest climate agenda in our nation’s history – one that will spur an equitable clean energy economy and cement the United States on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve our global climate goals we need cooperation from all major emitters, including oil and gas producing nations, to identify and act on solutions to phase out unabated fossil fuel emissions, while reducing emissions to the maximum extent possible in the interim. For this reason, the U.S. Department of Energy has led on creating a new international forum dedicated to developing long-term strategies to reach global net-zero emissions. Canada, Norway, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, collectively representing 40 percent of global oil and gas production, will come together to form a cooperative forum that will develop pragmatic net-zero emission strategies, including methane abatement, advancing the circular carbon economy approach, development and deployment of clean-energy and carbon capture and storage technologies, diversification from reliance on hydrocarbon revenues, and other measures in line with each country's national circumstances.","Joint Statement on Establishing a Net-Zero Producers Forum between the Energy Ministries of Canada, Norway, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United States",https://www.energy.gov/articles/joint-statement-establishing-net-zero-producers-forum-between-energy-ministries-canada
2021-04-29,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today awarded $19 million for 13 projects in traditionally fossil fuel-producing communities across the country to support production of rare earth elements and critical minerals vital to the manufacturing of batteries, magnets, and other components important to the clean energy economy. Facing persistent shortages in domestic supply, the U.S. has been forced to rely on imported materials, leaving clean energy technology production at greater risk of disruption. “The very same fossil fuel communities that have powered our nation for decades can be at the forefront of the clean energy economy by producing the critical minerals needed to build electric vehicles, wind turbines, and so much more,” said  Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm . “By building clean energy products here at home, we’re securing the supply chain for the innovative solutions needed to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 – all while creating good-paying jobs in all parts of America.” Production of rare earth elements and critical minerals, which serve as key components to several clean energy applications such as magnets in wind turbines and batteries in electric and conventional vehicles, is a prime example of how DOE is supporting regional economic growth and job creation in regions traditionally home to the fossil fuel industry. These funding awards align with last week's recommendations of the  White House Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization , which outlined a national roadmap to partner with local communities to ensure that the shift to a clean energy economy creates good-paying union jobs, spurs economic revitalization, and supports workers. “The coal industry downturn has left many West Virginians without the good-paying jobs they once relied on, which has negatively impacted our state economy. I am pleased that DOE is investing in West Virginia University’s Mid-Appalachian Carbon Ore, Rare Earth and Critical Minerals Initiative, which will work to expand and transition coal resources to other high-value products,” said  U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  “Not only will this project create innovative solutions for a cleaner energy future, but it will also spur economic growth and create good-paying jobs in the Mountain State. As Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I will continue to advocate for funding and resources to support research projects in West Virginia and across the United States that help our coal communities.”  “I commend Penn State for its work to receive this grant,” said  U.S. Senator Bob Casey . “Penn State’s world class research is a source of pride in the Commonwealth. Once again, its students and community of scholars has distinguished itself in the clean energy field. I have no doubt that this research will contribute to our nation’s development of clean energy.” “I am pleased Virginia Tech’s Center for Coal and Energy Research will receive federal funding to advance their research of natural resources found right here in the Commonwealth and help discover innovative uses for these resources,” said  U.S. Senator Mark Warner.  “This project will not only increase environmental sustainability in our communities, it will also help boost economic and job opportunity in the region.” “North Dakota provides a vast array of critical resources for the United States,” said  U.S. Senator John Hoeven . “This grant will support the University of North Dakota’s Energy & Environmental Research Center’s efforts to continue advancing the production of rare-earth elements, critical minerals and other carbon products from North Dakota lignite coal. This is vital as we continue adding value to our abundant lignite coal resources, enhancing domestic production to reduce reliance on foreign imports and supporting economic growth across the region.” “West Virginia has a great opportunity to become a leader in rare earth element and critical mineral production. With a focus on new technology, we can extract elements essential to manufacturing, technology, and energy production from acid mine drainage in our communities. Efforts like this will help revitalize localities in our state, while also cleaning up abandon mine sites. Last year, I authored language in the National Defense Authorization Act to encourage the Department of Defense to submit a report to Congress on the domestic supply chain and expansion of stockpiling these elements, and I’m thrilled to see WVU become the recipient of additional funding. I have also helped introduce legislation to improve the quality and timeliness of critical mineral production permitting on federal land. Taking advantage of this opportunity is vital to the future of West Virginia. I’m confident that WVU will continue to expand our understanding and operations in the field of rare earth element and critical mineral extraction,” said  U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito. “China’s near monopoly over rare earth metals makes the rest of the world dependent on them. With this funding, Utah will continue to play a vital role in United States’ production of rare earth metals and critical minerals, which will help rebuild our supply chain and decrease our dependence on China. Importantly, these projects will also create new jobs and spur economic growth for communities in the Uintah Basin,” said  U.S. Senator Mitt Romney. “The work at the Virginia Center for Coal and Energy Research has led to exciting breakthroughs in tapping sources of the rare earth minerals so integral to modern technology, used in everything from advanced batteries to smartphones,” said  U.S. Representative Morgan Griffith . “DOE’s award advances research that could support jobs in Appalachia and shore up supply chains vital to our country’s security and economic growth.” Selected projects fall under 12 areas of interest, corresponding to the selected U.S. basins that have the potential to produce rare earth elements and critical minerals. Projects will be managed by DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy’s  National Energy Technology Laboratory  (NETL). The Office of Fossil Energy (FE) funds research and development projects to reduce the risk and cost of advanced fossil energy technologies and further the sustainable use of the nation’s fossil energy resources.

2021-04-23,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —  In connection with a  White House report  on economic revitalization in coal and power plant communities, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced $109.5 million in funding for projects that directly support job creation in communities impacted by changes in the energy economy—the first results of a government-wide initiative launched by President Biden in the first week of his administration to boost the economic potential of coal and power plant communities. The White House Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization, housed within DOE, also selected a new Executive Director to spearhead interagency efforts.  “The coal and power plant workers who built our nation can play a huge role in making America’s clean energy future a reality, and this report outlines just the first steps the Biden Administration is taking to make sure they have those opportunities—right in their communities,” said  Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm . “This new DOE funding will help spark next-generation industries that these workers can not only participate in, but lead, and I look forward to working together on investments and strategies that empower, revitalize, and retain and create jobs in our energy communities.” “For generations, our coal miners have sacrificed their health and safety to mine the coal that forged the steel and provided the power that made the United States the greatest nation in the world,” said  Senator Joe Manchin . “I am encouraged to see President Biden acknowledge these contributions and start to allocate the resources that will be required to reinvest in these communities who have suffered huge job losses. I applaud today’s funding announcements for innovative technologies to tackle climate change and provide new opportunities for these hard-hit areas. In addition, the up to $15 million investment in important research conducted at West Virginia University is a small but first step in the right direction and I will continue working with the Administration to ensure additional, significant investments throughout West Virginia to provide meaningful opportunity and economic growth.” The Interagency Working Group named Brian Anderson as its Executive Director. A longtime resident of West Virginia and a descendant of coal miners, Anderson serves as director of DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory with facilities in Morgantown, West Virginia, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Albany, Oregon, and is a renowned scientist with extensive expertise in technology development for carbon management in hard-to-decarbonize sectors. In addition, DOE identified senior staff from its Office of Economic Impact and Diversity, Office of Energy Jobs, and Office of Indian Energy who will also support the work of the Interagency Working Group.   “It is a great honor to be named Executive Director of this essential effort,” said  Anderson . “I am excited to immediately begin this important work, reaching across the agencies of the federal government to ensure that the economies of traditional energy and power plant communities are strengthened, and my first priority will be to engage people where they work and live so that these hard hit communities have a hand in developing opportunities and solutions for their future.” Complementing investments in hydrogen, carbon capture, and environmental remediation proposed in the  American Jobs Plan , the Interagency Working Group report lays out a national roadmap to partner with local communities to ensure that the shift to a clean energy economy creates good-paying union jobs, spurs economic revitalization, and supports energy workers in coal, oil and gas and power plant communities. In the near term, it recommends creating jobs through remediation projects for oil and gas wells and coal mines — work that energy workers are well-suited for and allows economic development of under-utilized land. For the medium and long terms, the report calls for investing in low-carbon industries through technology such as carbon capture and hydrogen. The $109.5 million in funding DOE announced today will support innovative projects that will retain and rebuild jobs in energy communities, including: The Interagency Working Group also identified nearly $38 billion in existing federal funding that could be accessed by energy communities for infrastructure, environmental remediation, union job creation, community revitalization, and jobs well-suited to support hard-hit energy communities. As part of this effort, DOE’s Loan Programs Office released a  factsheet  to facilitate access to $8.5 billion in funding for deployment of carbon capture technology to enable low-carbon manufacturing of cement, steel, and other industrial products in addition to power plants. The Interagency Working Group’s report, as outlined by President Biden’s January 27  executive order  on tackling the climate crisis, identifies 25 communities across the country hardest hit by coal mine and power plant closures and calls for these areas to be priorities for both existing and future federal investment.

2021-05-04,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced a slate of new efforts, including $15.5 million in new funding, to support solar energy deployment in underserved communities and build a diverse, skilled workforce. These initiatives will help families and businesses that have been left behind in the clean energy transition to reap the benefits of cheaper power and access to highly-skilled jobs. Together, these efforts reflect the Biden Administration’s commitment to launching every American worker and community into a greener future. “Solar energy is one of the fastest, easiest, and cheapest paths to President Biden’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035—and now, it’s time to double down on our efforts to make those benefits available to communities in every pocket of the country,” said  Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm . “These new initiatives and funding will jumpstart a long-overdue conversation around how DOE can leverage solar energy’s explosive growth to create solutions and jobs that lift up Americans who have been left behind, and create a future filled with JEDI.” There are nearly 100 gigawatts DC (GW) of solar capacity currently installed across the country, and as much as 500 to 600 GW will be installed over the next 10 years. While DOE has continued to accelerate solar deployment by setting and meeting  ambitious cost goals , the “soft costs” associated with non-hardware challenges—like design, siting, permitting, installation, and financing—ultimately contribute to its overall cost to consumers. Increasing equitable access to solar includes driving down these costs, as well as developing business models like community solar that are designed to engage low- and moderate-income households. DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) will leverage existing technical assistance, community solar, and workforce development programs to tackle these challenges, as well as seek input from a diversity of stakeholders on solutions that address the needs of underserved communities. Funding Technical Assistance for Underserved Communities Through two longstanding programs— SolSmart  and the  Solar Energy Innovation Network —DOE has helped hundreds of cities, counties, states, utilities, and electric system operators tackle barriers to solar deployment, and will now emphasize assistance for underserved communities. Leveraging Benefits of Community Solar Projects Community solar can expand affordable access to solar to all Americans, by allowing everyone to share in the benefits regardless of whether their homes can support rooftop solar panels. Community solar projects are on the rise and span 39 states and the District of Columbia, but the bulk are in just four states and represent about 4% of solar capacity. In 2019, DOE launched the  National Community Solar Partnership —a $15 million initiative with over 500 partners and a goal to expand affordable community solar access to every U.S. household by 2025. To date, the Partnership has provided technical assistance to over 100 members. Increasing Workforce Diversity and Skills Training A diverse, skilled, and supported solar workforce is essential for developing clean energy solutions that benefit all Americans. Yet today, one-third of U.S. solar companies have reported difficulty in hiring qualified workers. For more information about SETO and its research priorities around soft costs, click  HERE .

2021-04-20,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced it will work with 11 remote and island communities around the United States and provide federal assistance to bolster their energy infrastructure, reduce the risk of outages, and improve their future energy and economic outlook. Due to their geographic isolation, remote coastal and island communities often face high energy costs and vulnerable energy infrastructure due to their increased risk of natural disasters and climate change. Watch  this video  to learn more about the program.  “Residents of remote and island communities face energy disruptions, natural disasters, and climate change impacts and pay some of the nation’s highest energy costs,” said  Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm.  “These 11 communities—working hand-in-hand with DOE’s network of experts—will implement resilient and secure clean energy solutions. It’s a win-win—environmentally impacted communities will benefit from cheaper, more reliable power in their homes and businesses while our country makes progress toward the Biden Administration’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035.” DOE’s Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project (ETIPP) will leverage the world-class expertise of DOE's experts and National Labs to advance local clean energy solutions and improve resilience for these 11 communities which, like other remote and island areas, often lack the financial resources and the access to experts to plan a clean energy transition. ETIPP employs a community-led and inclusive approach by identifying the energy challenges of each community and providing strategic assistance to help them determine and direct their energy transition. “As the threats of climate change grow more severe, it is essential that communities across the country make investments in clean, resilient infrastructure,” said  Senators Susan Collins and Angus King.  “This is especially true for coastal Maine towns, which have both high risks associated with climate change and an immense amount of untapped natural resources at their disposal. This funding will support the efforts of Eastport and Islesboro to build 21st century infrastructure that will support the region’s energy needs in the short-term and lay the groundwork for long-term resiliency.” ""For our island state that has long depended on imported oil, a clean energy future means resiliency and economic security. I want to thank the Department of Energy for selecting two Hawaii communities for the Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project. These projects address two of the most important steps in achieving our goal to become carbon negative by 2045—clean transportation and grid improvements,"" said  Senator Brian Schatz. “I applaud the Department of Energy for helping island communities plan the best way to meet their unique energy needs in a more affordable, resilient, and sustainable way. The Energy Transitions Initiative is focused on embracing local knowledge and helping community organizations use federal expertise and assistance to find solutions to the unique energy needs of each island community. Accelerating assistance will speed up Hawaii’s transition to renewable energy for our vehicles, homes, and businesses in the face of climate change challenges,"" said  Senator Mazie Hirono. Previous DOE initiatives helped New Orleans rebuild from Hurricane Katrina with funding for  advanced microgrids  to power parts of the city and trained Hawaii utilities officials on building more  capacity for renewable energy sources . The 11 selected communities are: These projects are funded by Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s  Energy Transition Initiative ,  Solar Energy Technologies Office ,  Water Power Technologies Office , and are supported by the cross-cutting expertise of  DOE’s Office of Electricity . Five regional stakeholder engagement partners will help communities identify and prioritize their energy resilience needs and connect them to experts from DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

2021-04-27,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —  In support of the Biden Administration’s commitment to modernize the nation’s power grid and infrastructure and deliver 100% clean energy to businesses and homeowners by 2035, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced the availability of up to $8.25 billion in loans from its Loan Programs Office (LPO) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) for efforts to expand and improve the nation’s transmission grid. This is one of several Biden Administration announcements made today underscoring its commitment to accelerating efforts to expand and modernize the nation’s electrical grid, creating good-paying unions jobs while increasing access to reliable, affordable, clean power.   “DOE is making financing available for projects that improve resilience and expand transmission capacity across the electrical grid, so we can reliably move clean energy from places where it’s produced to places where it’s needed most,” said  Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm . “This is a down payment on our efforts to modernize our transmission nationwide—but we need the American Jobs Plan to complete them. These investments will make our power system more resilient against threats and more reliable as we increase our clean energy capacity, creating thousands of jobs in the process.” President Biden’s American Jobs Plan calls for historic investments to modernize and upgrade the country’s power grid, improving resilience against cyber threats, natural disasters, and physical attacks. This includes expansion and upgrades to transmission lines—which are also essential to the administration’s goal of reaching 100% clean electricity by 2035. Renewable energy capacity is often generated far away from population centers where demand is highest. Without added transmission capacity, the electricity grid cannot reliably and consistently deliver renewably sourced power from these points of generation to high demand areas. As DOE joins federal efforts to increase the grid’s renewable energy capacity—such as the plan  announced last month  to add 30 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030—Secretary Granholm has made addressing transmission challenges a key priority. Today’s announcement lays out financial tools that DOE can bring to bear in support of transmission development. Passage of the American Jobs Plan will allow DOE to expand on these resources.

2021-04-15,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today unveiled two funding opportunities totaling more than $162 million to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions among cars, trucks, and off-road vehicles. The funding will support the next stage of the SuperTruck initiatives—aimed at electrifying freight trucking—along with efforts to expand electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and lower emissions for on- and off-road vehicles. “Getting to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 means we must aggressively cut down the largest source of emissions: the transportation sector,” said  Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm . “DOE’s first two SuperTruck initiatives led the biggest truck makers in the American semi market to take massive leaps in fuel efficiency. This new funding triples down on that progress with a push towards electrifying trucks of all sizes, along with efforts to expand EV charging access and develop low-emission car engines.” Building a clean energy economy to address the climate crisis is a top priority of the Biden Administration, and the transportation sector will play a critical part in the effort. Transportation accounts for approximately  30% of total U.S. energy needs  and generates the  largest share of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions . DOE’s new funding seeks to address the two largest contributors to  transportation sector emissions : passenger cars and light-duty trucks, which are responsible for nearly 60%, and medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which cover nearly a quarter. SuperTruck 3 Funding Opportunity New technologies, business models, and consumer demands are among several factors changing how freight moves in the U.S. Combined, these changes present a unique opportunity to re-envision the trucking sector as more economical and sustainable—supporting domestic jobs, the nation’s economy, and the administration’s clean energy goals all at once. DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) initially  launched the SuperTruck initiatives  in 2009, aimed to improve heavy-duty truck freight efficiency by 50%, while the follow-up SuperTruck 2 in 2016 sought to double fuel efficiency for 18-wheeler (“class 8”) trucks. The initiatives attracted participation of truck makers comprising over 99% of the U.S. truck market. Within seven years, four of them—Volvo, Daimler, Cummins/Peterbilt, and Navistar—had exceeded the first SuperTruck goal. The five SuperTruck 2 projects are on track to more than double class 8 miles per gallon.   EERE’s Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) and Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office (HFTO) are partnering on the “SuperTruck 3” Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to offer up to $100 million in funding over four years—subject to appropriations—to pioneer electrified medium- and heavy-duty trucks and freight system concepts that achieve even higher efficiency and lower emissions. The funding focuses on a range of approaches to electrification—all-electric, plug-in hybrid systems using renewable biofuels, and hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, including hybridization strategies such as fuel cell range extenders. “Climate chaos is the greatest existential threat of our lifetimes, and it’s going to take an all-hands-on-deck approach to slash the pollution—much of which comes from the transportation sector—that is fanning the flames of the crisis,” said  Senator Jeff Merkley . “By leaning into American ingenuity and innovation, we can use new technologies to chart a path forward—one that will help create jobs, protect our health and security, and lead the world toward a more sustainable future. I’m grateful for the hard work of Oregonians who are contributing to that effort by developing world-class low-emission freight trucks with the support of SuperTruck funding, and I will continue to do all I can to make these investments possible in the years to come, as we work to thwart the most catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis.” “Our modern approach to energy should be ‘all of the above’ not an ‘everything but’ solution. SuperTruck is a vital program not only to Indiana’s Sixth Congressional District, but to the path forward in expanding America’s energy capabilities and independence.” said  U.S. Representative Greg Pence . “I came to Congress to ensure Hoosiers back home in Indiana have a seat at the table, which means prioritizing job creation and economic growth for my constituents – and this investment will accomplish just that.” Low Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Technologies Funding Opportunity VTO is also offering up to $62.75 million as part of its “Low Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Technologies Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment” FOA for innovative solutions to reducing emissions and increasing efficiencies for on- and off-road vehicles. To accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption, the FOA will support expansion of EV infrastructure and charging, along with community-level EV demonstrations that can lower barriers to EV adoption—such as piloting EV car sharing and installing EV charging within multi-unit housing. The FOA is also open to projects developing advanced engines and fuels that operate with lower emissions. The application processes will include two phases: a concept paper and a full application. Concept papers are due May 13, 2021, and full applications are due July 12, 2021. Applicants are required to submit a plan for achieving diversity, equity, and inclusion objectives, including support for people from underrepresented groups in STEM, advancing equity within the project team, and producing benefits for underserved communities.
